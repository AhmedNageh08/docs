  The event is the former message, but way more flexible, allowing us to use it
  for different goals. Currently, we only use it for messages and some room
  events.

# Event

### Interface Definition

```typescript
interface IEvent<T extends EDataDefinition> {
	_id: string;
	_cid?: string;
	_pids: Array<string>;
	v: number;
	ts: Date;
	src: string;
	ct: EventContext;
	cid: string;
	t: EventTypeDescriptor;
	dHash: string;
	d: T;
	isLeaf: boolean;
	_deletedAt?: Date;
}
```

Properties description:

* `_id`: The event id, which is a SHA256 hash of the `src`, `ct`, `cid`, `_pids`, `t`, `ts`, `dHash`
* `_cid`: This is the "id generated by the client", on V1 our clients generate the `_id` of the message, so this needs to be here for backward compatibility
* `_pids`: The ids of the previous events
* `v`: The version of the schema
* `src`: The source of this event, which server, this will be used to federate events later on
* `ct`: This is part of the context, holds the type of the context \(for example, "room"\), more in [EventContext](event-context.md)
* `cid`: This is also part of the context, holds the of the context \(like the room id\)
* `t`: The type of the event, details in [EventTypeDescriptor](event-type-descriptor.md)
* `dHash`: The hash of some or all of the properties on `d`, depending on the event type
* `d`: The event's data, the payload, details in [EDataDefinition](event-data-definition/)
* `_updatedAt`: When this event was updated

Example of types "room" and "msg":
